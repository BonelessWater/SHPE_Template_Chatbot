Create Engaging Educational Content on Data Structures and Algorithms

Scope:

Data Structures: Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Hash Tables, Trees (BST, AVL, Heaps), Graphs
Algorithms: Sorting (Merge, Quick, Bubble Sort), Searching (Binary Search), Recursion, Dynamic Programming, Divide and Conquer, Greedy, Graph Algorithms (DFS, BFS, Dijkstraâ€™s, A*), Backtracking
Include Big-O complexity analysis for each topic
Format:

Modular lessons by difficulty: Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced
Code snippets in Python, C++, and Java
Visualizations for complex concepts (e.g., linked list traversal, merge sort animation)
Real-World Applications:

Explain practical use cases (e.g., Hash Tables in indexing, Graphs in Google Maps)
Optional Interactive Elements:

Add quizzes or coding challenges for practice
Include step-by-step solutions for platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, Codeforces
Learning Support:

Use text, flowcharts, diagrams, and optionally, 3-5 minute video scripts
Maintain a conversational tone to simplify complex topics
Bonus Features:

Provide cheat sheets and project ideas (e.g., a mini-database using a B-Tree)"""
